	Live Demo
	---------------
	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/detail/image-navigation-menu-tabs
	

	Functionality
	---------------
	
	We have lot of Navigation menu tabs in jquery / css.
	
	But this one is entirely on Image Menu Tabs
	
	Here each and every navigation menu has image respectively.
	When hover on menu, displays the hovering image
	when clicked on menu, displays the clicked image
	
	
	How to use it
	---------------
	There are 3 images for one Menu Tab
		ie 	normal	: its the normal image
			hover	: its the image when you hover on normal image
			clicked	: its the image when you clicked on normal / hover image
			
	For example
	
	We have 3 Navigation Menu  Tabs 
	
	MenuOne, MenuTwo, MenuThree
	
	We need to rename the images with -n , -h, -c respective functionality below
	
	
	Functionality	|	MenuOne	|	MenuTwo		|	MenuThree 	|
	-------------------------------------------------------------
					|			|				|				|
	at Normal 		|	a-n.png	|	b-n.png		|	c-n.png		|
					|			|				|				|
	on Hover 		|	a-h.png	|	b-h.png		|	c-h.png		|
					|			|				|				|
	at Active		|	a-c.png	|	b-c.png		|	c-c.png		|
					|			|				|				|
	-------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Legends 
			-n : for Normal Image
			-h : for Hovering Image
			-c : for Clicked or Active Image.
			
			Just rename the image before executing
